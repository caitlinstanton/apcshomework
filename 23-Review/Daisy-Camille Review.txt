//Room.java
Makes perfect sense to me. I understand that it is unifinished (you guys haven't
written in the code for the mouse events methods), but it still creates a pretty
good room environment. I understand that each item in the room is an instance of
Stuff class, instances that are to be added to the inventory ArrayList. 
The mouseClicked() method seems to do all it's supposed to. It checks to see if you've clicked
the painting, then loads that image, if it exists. It also has checks to see if the
other items have been clicked (then prints out something when they are). I realize
those checks will probably do more later on.
Overall, this code looks good, considering its unfinished.

//Popup.java
The way I see the purpose of this class is that it's to open other windows once
you click on a certain thing, like a painting or drawer. It's quite general,
since you mentioned it's an abstract class, so it makes sense that there isn't
a lot here. There's an empty BufferedImage so that you can set that image later.
The mouse events aren't written yet, but that might just be because the consequences
differe based on the popup box.
Looks good.
